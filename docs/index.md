# Welcome to DoubleU Labs

Welcome to DoubleU Labs docs.

This site contains writeups of all of the projects that comprise my Homelab.

:construction: It is still very much under construction, so don't mind the mess.

## Showcase

- [root-ca](./root_ca/index.md): This is how I set up my own Root Certificate
Authority (CA) using a YubiKey and deployed the assets to Github Pages using a
script-based toolkit I developed
([`ca-bootstrap`](https://github.com/doubleu-labs/ca-bootstrap){target="\_blank"}).

## The Future

I've got quite a few projects in the works involving Kubernetes, out-of-band
management, hardware bootstrapping, and several service integrations.

Once the processes of these projects are finalized, the full documentation will
be published here, so be in the lookout.
